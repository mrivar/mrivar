## Hi there 👋 I'm Martín

🌍 I'm a Full Stack Developer, coding my way through life from Barcelona, Spain.

With over 8 years of experience under my belt, I’ve navigated the dynamic landscape of software development, mastering everything from crafting sleek, user-friendly front-ends (as best as I can given my poor design skills!) to architecting robust and intricate back-end services.

🔭 I’m currently working on my own [website](https://mrivar.github.io/), hosted right here on GitHub, where you can dive into my [source code](https://github.com/mrivar/mrivar.github.io-code)—completely open for all to explore. Join me on this journey!
